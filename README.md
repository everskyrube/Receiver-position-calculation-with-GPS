# Receiver-position-calculation-with-GPS
This work is implemented on MatLab, and it uses raw pseudoranges and satellite ephemeris data as input, to calculate the user position in ECEF as well as the user clock bias. 


Note: Requires the script config.m to be in the same directory.
Note: The Data folder should be put in the project directory (relative path)
